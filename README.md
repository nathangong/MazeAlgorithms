# Mazes
This project visualizes a collection of many well known maze generation and pathfinding algorithms.

## Generation Algorithms
* DFS
* BFS
* Hunt and Kill
* Kruksal's MST
* Binary Tree

## Pathfinding Algorithms
* DFS
* BFS
* A*
* Greedy Best First Search

## How to use
Start by running the program either through an IDE or opening up the jar file that's located in `out/artifacts/mazegenerator_jar/mazegenerator.jar`. After running the program, two separate windows will pop up - one of which is the control menu. Through this menu, you can change the delay between frames, the algorithm used to generate a maze, and the algorithm used to traverse a maze. In order to generate a maze through the selected algorithm, click the "Generate Maze" button. To traverse the maze, click the "Traverse Maze" button. Finally, to clear the maze in order to generate another one, click the "Clear Maze" button.
